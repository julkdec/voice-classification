Created a project for classification of pathological changes in voice using deep learning techniques.  
Voice recordings were taken from Saarbruecken Voice Database and each recording was submitted to Automatic Speech Recognition in order to extract single words from a sentence. Simple model of convolutional neural network was used to detect healthy or pathological samples.
